# Mobile App — Onboarding

---

## Flow

```
1. Phone OTP
   └── Enter phone → receive SMS → enter code → verified

2. ID Scan (KYC SDK — Sumsub or similar)
   └── Camera opens → scan national ID front + back → OCR extracts data

3. Selfie + Liveness
   └── Camera opens → take selfie → liveness check → match against ID photo

4. Data Entry (6+ sections, multi-screen)
   ├── 4a. Document Data (pre-filled from OCR)
   │   └── Full name, DOB, father name, mother name, expiry date, issue date, location, etc.
   ├── 4b. Work Data
   │   └── Employment status, employer, job title, sector, etc.
   ├── 4c. Income & Source of Funds
   │   └── Monthly income, income source, source of funds, etc.
   ├── 4d. Location
   │   └── Current address, city, governorate, etc.
   ├── 4e. Bank Usage
   │   └── Purpose of account, expected transaction volume, etc.
   └── 4f. (More sections TBD)

5. Review & Submit
   └── User reviews all data → submit → application sent to backend → queued for backoffice

6. Polling / Waiting
   └── Animated waiting screen → polls server → push notification on decision
   └── Approved → redirect to login
   └── Rejected → show reason → "Try Again" button → restart from step 1
```

## Step State Machine

```
PHONE_OTP → ID_SCAN → SELFIE_LIVENESS → DATA_DOCUMENT → DATA_WORK
    → DATA_INCOME → DATA_LOCATION → DATA_BANK_USAGE → REVIEW → SUBMITTED
    → APPROVED / REJECTED
```

Server tracks `current_step` and `status`. Mobile reads from server on resume.

---

## Resume Logic

User can close app at any point and come back:

```
App launch → GET /onboarding/status
    │
    ├── No application → start fresh (phone OTP)
    ├── IN_PROGRESS → route to current_step
    ├── SUBMITTED → route to polling screen
    ├── APPROVED → route to login
    └── REJECTED → route to rejection screen (with retry)
```

This works even after app reinstall — state is server-side, identified by phone number + device.

---

## KYC SDK Integration

The ID scan and selfie/liveness steps use a third-party SDK (Sumsub or similar).

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Corebridge     │────►│   KYC SDK        │────►│  KYC Server  │
│   Mobile App     │◄────│   (native view)  │◄────│  (Sumsub)    │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └──────────────┘
        │                                               │
        │           OCR data + match result             │
        └───────────────── backend ◄────────────────────┘
```

- SDK opens a native camera view (not our UI)
- On completion, SDK returns: OCR data, face match score, liveness result
- Backend validates the result with the KYC provider's server
- Mobile receives: extracted document data (for pre-filling forms) + pass/fail

## Data Entry Forms

Each data entry screen is a form backed by:
- **Validation rules** from `contracts/validations/` (auto-generated)
- **Redux slice** stores partial form data (survives step navigation)
- **Shared `FormField` component** renders each field (RTL-aware, error display)

## Polling Screen

After submission, user sees a waiting screen:

- Animated illustration (processing / reviewing)
- Status text: "Your application is being reviewed"
- Polls `GET /onboarding/result` every 30 seconds
- Also listens for push notification (faster than polling)
- No back button — user can only close app
- On return to app → same polling screen (server says SUBMITTED)

---

## Rejection & Retry

If rejected:
- Show reason from backoffice (e.g., "ID photo unclear", "Information mismatch")
- "Try Again" button → clears onboarding slice → starts from step 1
- Backend creates a new `onboarding_application` for the same phone number
- Previous application kept for audit
